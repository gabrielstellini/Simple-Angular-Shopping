Hi there, welcome to our website! This is an angular 2 based e-commerce website where users can buy items.
It makes use of the following technologies to achieve this:

MongoDB
PHP 5.6/Apache with Mongodb driver
Angular 4

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.

## Installation/Hosting
To host the website, use the following commands:
`npm install` - install all package dependencies
`npm start` - deploys the website to `http://localhost:4200/`

## Development server
Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
These tests have not been implemented yet.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
