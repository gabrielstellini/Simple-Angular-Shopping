# Simple Angular Shopping Site
Hi there, welcome to our website! This is an angular 2 based e-commerce website where users can buy items.
It makes use of the following technologies (as per the module requirements) to achieve this:

MongoDB and PHP 5.6 as a backend
Angular 4 single page app as the front end

## Installation/Hosting
To host the website, use the following commands:
`npm install` - install all package dependencies
`npm start` - deploys the website to `http://localhost:4200/`

## Development server
Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the `angular-cli` use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
